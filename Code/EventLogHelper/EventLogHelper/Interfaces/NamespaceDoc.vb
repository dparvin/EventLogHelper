    ''' <summary>
    ''' This namespace contains interfaces that define contracts for event log helpers,
    ''' enabling consistent logging behavior across different implementations.

    ''' <remarks>
    ''' <para>
    ''' The interfaces in this namespace provide abstractions for logging functionality,
    ''' allowing for flexible and interchangeable components that can log events to the
    ''' Windows Event Log or other logging systems.

    ''' <para>
    ''' By programming against these interfaces, applications can achieve greater
    ''' modularity and testability, as different implementations can be swapped
    ''' without changing the consuming code.
